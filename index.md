# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](https://github.com/mikemoore26/mikemoore26.github.io/blob/master/projects/SeoulBikeData.ipynb)

<img src="images/sbike.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

***

- Used logistic regression to identify potential bankers based on various attributes.
- Implemented SMOTE to balance class labels.
- Created the confusion matrix for the predictions and make note of the outputs.
- Created a classification report and eplored the various outputs.
- Model had an accuracy score 91.25%.

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](https://github.com/mikemoore26/mikemoore26.github.io/blob/master/projects/Bone(knn_NB).ipynb)

<img src="images/knee.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance

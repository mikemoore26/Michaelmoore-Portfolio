# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

***
[Predicting a Patient Heart Condition](https://github.com/mikemoore26/Heart_Disease)

<img src="images/heart_img.jpeg" />

- <b>Skills Used:</b> Python,sklearn,logistic Regression,pandas,numpy, pickle
- <b> Project Objective:</b> Predicting Heart Disease. Analyze the data set and identify most relevant heart disease related risk factors as well as predict the overall risk.

- <b>Quantifiable Result</b>: Used various logisitic models to find the appropreite model to get more accurate scores But By using Random Forest we got accuracy 94%
